This is our quantum propagation code.

FFT2D_Quantum
	This is the split operator quantum code.

Propagate_interpolate
	This is the classical code for propagation.

Potentialâ€¦
	This stores the potential that we're using, along with derivatives of the potential and spacial vectors representing the dimensions of the space.

betterbinz
	Is used to display the classical results as a density.
